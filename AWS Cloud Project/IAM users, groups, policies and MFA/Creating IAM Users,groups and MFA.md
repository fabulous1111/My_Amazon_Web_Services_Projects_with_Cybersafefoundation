# Using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to manage access to AWS services and resources securely, as well as setting up Multi-Factor Authenticator (MFA) for extra protection of the environment
## Create IAM user
IAM is a service in AWS that is used to grant permission to different AWS services.
 To create an IAM user

> 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console

> 2. From the left pane, select users and click add users 

If you want to add multiple users, choose Add another user for each additional user and type their user names

> 3. Type the user name for the new user

> 4. Select the type of access this set of users will have

Create credentials for the user, depending on the type of access the user requires:

 • Programmatic access

Create an access key (access key ID and a secret access key) for the user

 • AWS Management Console Access

If the user needs to access the AWS Management Console, Choose one of the following: Autogenerated password or Custom password 

> 3. Set permissions

Give the user permissions to perform the required tasks by adding the user to one or more groups. You can also grant permissions by attaching permissions policies directly to the user or Copy permissions from existing user

> 4. Tag: It is use for organizing (OPTIONAL)

> 5. Review and create user

 To see all of the choices you made up to this point

> 6. View the users' access keys

To save the access keys, choose Download .csv and then save the file to a safe location


> 7. Provide each user with his or her credentials

Username and URL to the account sign-in page

# Creating IAM user groups
To set up a user group, you need to create the group. Then give the group permissions based on the type of work that you expect the users in the group to do

> 1. Under the IAM console, Click groups on the left pane then choose create group 

> 2. User group name
Type the name of the group

> 3. In the list of users, select the check box for each user that you want to add to the group.

> 4. Attach policy: This is determined by job role  

> 5. Choose Create group

# Add user to group

> Click on "users" from left pane and select username to be added to group then click the "Groups" tab
click "Add user to groups"

> Select group you want user to be

# IAM inline policies

> Go back to users and click on the newly created user "Audit". 
select the policy tab and click "Add inline policy"

> Select Json and add your custom policy
Note: you can search policy up on google/amazon documentry and edit

> Review and create policy

# Assign MFA

> From users tab click on security credentials
Locate Assigned MFA device and click "Manage"

> Choose "Virtual MFA device" and continue    

> Scan QR code using an authenticator app
Enter 2 different codes generated by authenticator
click assign MFA

> MFA assigned successfully

## Best practices include the following

 • Require multi-factor authentication (MFA)

• Safeguard your root user credentials and don't use them for everyday tasks

 • Regularly review and remove unused users, roles, permissions, policies, and credentials

 • Do not login with your email
